## General Thoughts
When coding, I like to keep things simple. At least initially, I prefer to write code that directly solves the problem in a clear and understandable way. This makes it easier to revisit later without struggling to decipher my own logic. I know that some problems have more complex solutions, but for now, my priority is to solve them efficiently rather than overcomplicating things. Looking back at my early code, I can see significant differences in both my approach to problem-solving and how I format my code.

## VSCode and ESLint
Since high school, I have primarily used IntelliJ and have grown somewhat comfortable with it. However, there are still advanced features I haven't explored yet. That said, I think VSCode is a solid alternative. The clean interface is refreshing, and the ability to quickly install and enable extensions makes it easy to get started. Iâ€™d like to use it more for future projects.

One of the popular extensions for VSCode is ESLint. Personally, I have mixed feelings about it. While it helps with autofilling some code, I find its indentation rules frustrating, and the minor errors it flags can be distracting. Maybe as I work on larger projects, I'll come to appreciate its value more.
