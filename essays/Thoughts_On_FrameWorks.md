## Introduction to FrameWorks
When I was first introduced to the UI Frameworks I felt pretty overwhelmed. The only sort of programming I have really done are assignments for college in Java or little games or small projects here and there in the same language to practice. I probably didn't spend enough time learning html and css before jumping into frameworks so that also made it somewhat difficult to fully grasp everything. Being introduced to FrameWorks such as Bootstrap has been really good for my progress in my opinion though. While I do think I am struggling I think in the long run it will pay off. My landing page in a year or two will look drastically different, I hope in a good way, and I will thank myself for putting in the work.

## What's Bootstrap like?
At first Bootstrap seemed like a lot. I thought that there were a lot of things that seemed helpful but had no idea what some stuff does and what some stuff still does. I think that Bootstrap is definitely helpful in with things that may seem tedious and have already been done for you, but that is frameworks in general. Bootstrap seems to have a large amount of selection for icons which I like. There are many that seem very practical and couple that I have seen that look fun to throw in here and there as well. Bootstrap also helped me think smarter, it helped me not worry about tedious small things and helped me progress more efficiently through my coding and building. Even though I have just started I feel as though Bootstrap is pretty good and helpful and look forward to using it a lot more in the future.

##Thoughts On Using Frameworks
I think that using frameworks is good and definitely gets rid of the small tedious things. I mean if somebody has already created something that was intended to be used, then why not use it, especially if it looks good. That said I think that building your fundamentals is good as well. I think that jumping right into using Frameworks can have its drawbacks as well. You may not fully understand the idea of it and lose some skill that may have been gained from using only html and css for a while before using the crutch of Frameworks. I definitly think that I could have learned a lot more before using Frameworks but not that I know about it and access it I have no discipline to go back and only use raw html and css. In the end Frameworks are great and useful tool but I would recommend not rushing into it immediately.
