## Effort Estimates
I made my effort estimates based on how I’ve done with past assignments and projects. If a task seemed similar to something I had worked on before, I would use that as a reference point and guess how long it would take. At first, I underestimated my effort because I thought it would motivate me to stay focused and finish faster. But over time, I realized that overestimating gave me a better cushion and reduced stress, especially when tasks turned out to be more difficult than expected.

Even though my estimates were often off, sometimes by a lot, I still found value in making them. Having an estimate gave me a sense of structure and helped me plan my week. It also made it easier to balance tasks across the team. For example, if I saw that one of my issues was going to take longer than others, my teammates could pick up extra tickets to keep the group on track. That type of early communication helped us avoid last-minute scrambles and kept things more organized.

## Effort Estimate Benefits
Estimating effort ahead of time helped me break the work into manageable pieces and spread it out over several days. That way, I wasn’t rushing to finish everything the night before a deadline. Overestimating especially helped with planning, since I could set a comfortable daily pace and adjust if something unexpected came up. It also gave the team a clearer picture of workload, which helped balance the overall project flow.

## Actual Effort Benifits
Tracking actual effort was helpful mostly because it gave me a clearer understanding of how long different types of tasks really take. Sometimes the time matched my estimate pretty well, which meant I had a solid grasp of the task. But other times, the actual time was way off, which showed that I either underestimated the complexity or didn’t know what I was getting into. That kind of reflection helped me improve my future estimates. The only downside was that tracking got repetitive at times, but it wasn’t a major issue.

## tracking Efforts
I tracked my actual effort using a notepad for the most part. I’d write down the start and stop times or log what I completed at the end of the day. If I worked on something for an extended period, I’d just add up the total and keep a running log. Sometimes I’d finish an issue in one sitting and just write that time down all at once. I think my tracking was fairly accurate, though I probably forgot to log some short sessions here and there. But overall, it gave me a solid overview of how much time I was putting in.

## Overhead
There wasn’t much overhead in tracking my time. Using a notepad was quick and easy and didn’t interrupt my workflow. Once I got into the habit of jotting things down after I finished a session or task, it became routine. It didn’t take up a noticeable amount of time or stop me from focusing on the project. While it could feel tedious, especially for non-coding tasks, it was still worth it for the insights I got in return.
