## Thoughts on Typescript
I think typescript has some things that make it useful and fun. It comes with a lot of tools and documentation to help a newer coder who may be overwhelmed with how much there is to learn and make it a bit easier for them to learn.  I think that if you came from learning javascript then the transition would be pretty easy. Personally coming from mainly and only really using Java some of the syntax was hard to get down especially the let and const and var definitions for variables.  It was also confusing a little bit the way to set up and start the functions compared to that in Java.  I think typescript works and has its benefits but as of right now I would prefer to use java.

## Hopes for Typescript
By the end of ICS 314 and my college years, I hope to feel more confident using TypeScript and improve my overall proficiency with it. I want to not only understand its syntax but also learn best practices for writing clean and efficient TypeScript code. Ideally, I hope to reach a point where switching between Java and TypeScript feels natural, allowing me to work seamlessly across different projects.  

## Persuit of Software Engineering
I am currently employed for UH Groupings and work as a software engineer and have been working at Groupings for a couple months now. I beleive I still have much to learn and have only really started with making integrations tests using Java to test the API part of the site. While I have been wanting to branch out and start working on other parts of the project I honestly have been struggling on trying to find a place to start. During this course I believe I will pick up many tools that will not only help me in my current jobs, but with my future employment as well. I hope to be able to continue to grow my passion for software engineering as well as coding in general. I hope that in the future I will become more headstrong when it comes to problem solving with different languages as well as using different tools.  I hope to be able to attain the skillsets required to become a good software developer for my future employers.
