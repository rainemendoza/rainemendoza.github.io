## Thoughts on Typescript
I think typescript has some things that make it useful and fun. It comes with a lot of tools and documentation to help a newer coder who may be overwhelmed with how much there is to learn and make it a bit easier for them to learn.  I think that if you came from learning javascript then the transition would be pretty easy. Personally coming from mainly and only really using Java some of the syntax was hard to get down especially the let and const and var definitions for variables.  It was also confusing a little bit the way to set up and start the functions compared to that in Java.  I think typescript works and has its benefits but as of right now I would prefer to use java.

## Hopes for Typescript
I am currently taking this class as of my spring semester in 2025. I hope throughout this course, ICS 314, I learn more on how to use typescript and more nietche functions that it has. I hope by the end of this course my knowledge now compared to that of the end will seem like a drop compared to a puddle.  I don't expect myself to become a savant after this course but to become more confident and comfortable with using this language either professionaly for a job or for recreational use. Maybe after using Typescript more, who knows, maybe I will end up liking it more than Java
