## Introduction
AI has made its way into education much like the many daily tasks that people use it for. Due to the accesibility that it has to information and how fast it is, many people depend on it for simple or complex answers that can be answered faster than a google search due to not having to go through many links and sites to find the specific information a person may be looking for. In education especially students may find themselves using AI to get access to material that may make it easier or more efficient to do assignments faster than before. AI also has prevelance in Software Engineering as it can help detect errors in code as well as when given certain prompts it can even generate projects and pages itself without any previous code. I personally use Chatgpt the most but have used Gemeni, Grok, and Claude here and there as well.

## Personal Experience With AI
For the experience Wods that I used AI to help speed up my process of work. If I got stuck sometimes I would ask the AI to give me some code to help fix what I was working on. The In-Class practice wods I would also use AI to use if I got stuck. If I really needed help I would copy paste the instructions for the wod into the AI to see how they did and see what I did wrong. For the in-class wods it was similar, when I got stuck I would take the part where I couldn't code and ask the AI to come up with some code that I could insert into mine to make it work. An example would be "The following code doesn't seem to work: ... according to these instructions it should do this .... Could you help me create something that would mesh with my code and do the intended instructions."  For the final project I would use it a lot. Many of it was asking it, "Take a look at this file ...., does it seem to be properly made or coded, these other files are also connected ..., are they connected correctly and used in the right way." For the tutorials and concepts I didn't really use ai and more focused on the reading the documentation or looking at videos that used or showed what I was supposed to be learning. For answering question in class I didn't use AI because I either knew it or didn't answer. I didn't really answer any questions in the Discord. I did not use AI for answering or asking a smart-question, I used stack-overflow to find one and used it to answer it as well.  I used AI to help give specific coding examples. An example would be, "I want to create a db for a project I'm creating, how would I go about this and what would it look like." If I didn't understand some code that it would give me I would ask it to explain it and how it was used. I didn't document code so because of that I did not ask AI to do any documentation. In the VS Code I asked the AI and used it to help fix ES Lint errors as well as other in file errors I could not solve. It usually was the built in one and only had to click a few butons.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding
AI has definitely helped me and progress my knowledge and experience with coding and software development. I think that if you have good fundamentals and basic understanding of things that you are doing then it can help progress and get over small humps and bumps that you may experience and get lost in but AI helps smooth it out and guide you in times when you don't know where to look and what you don't know. Getting experience and hands on is good for progressing a software engineer and AI helps with that as it helps you create and code more and more without getting stuck. Due to constantly practicing soon you will pick up on things that you were missing and AI was noticing for you. That being said you should not use as a crutch too much. Learning the basic and fundamentals of what you will be doing is crucial. If you dont undersstand the basics then you won't really learn from the AI practice and code and will more just use it to get things done instead of trying to understand it. 

## Practical Applications
In the real world AI is significantly used in projects and development. Many people seem to be working on different tools specifally for software engineers to make coding easier and more efficient. Github Copilot in VSCode uses ai to help code along with you when you need it and help fix errors you make. AI is extremely valuable in todays software engineering world as it allows for more efficiency and faster progress with projects and things. For things such as challenges it can be used to help set up a basic structure of a person's idea for a project and allow for the student to build off of it and make it more complex. It can help get rid of tedious and costly time activities in some coding parts of a project.

## Challenges and Opportunities
Traditional teaching methods in software engineering usually involve lectures, textbooks, and classroom discussions. They are good for building a strong foundation, but can sometimes be less engaging and slower to adapt to individual learning styles. Students often have to wait for feedback and may struggle to keep up if the pace doesn’t match their needs. On the other hand, AI-enhanced learning makes things more interactive and personal. It can adjust lessons to fit each student, offer instant feedback on coding tasks, and use tools like virtual labs to help practice real world skills. This makes learning more fun and helps students remember things better. AI also makes it easier to reach more students, since everything can be online and scalable. However, it still has some challenges, like needing good data and being careful with privacy. Overall, using both traditional and AI-powered methods together can give the best results by combining structure and flexibility to prepare students for the fast-changing tech world.

## Future Considerations
AI is set to play a major role in the future of software engineering education by making learning more personalized, efficient, and hands-on. As AI tools get smarter, they could offer real-time feedback on code, simulate complex projects, and help students learn at their own pace. However, challenges like ensuring fairness, avoiding reliance on automation, and protecting student data must be addressed. To improve, educators and developers need to work together to design AI tools that support creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration, not just technical skills. With the right balance, AI can transform how we teach and learn software engineering.

## Conclusion
AI has had a strong impact on my learning experience in software engineering by making tasks quicker and offering helpful support when I got stuck. It’s a powerful tool for learning, especially when combined with a solid understanding of the basics. Going forward, I believe AI should be better integrated into software engineering courses in a way that encourages learning, not just shortcuts. Instructors should guide students on how to use AI effectively, such as for feedback, code improvement, or project ideas while also emphasizing the importance of understanding the core concepts. With thoughtful use, AI can continue to be a helpful partner in both education and development.
