  The reason I got into coding was because of a mentor I had in Highschool as well as my brother.  My younger brother got into coding before me and wanted to start a club. I decided to join him and help start one as well as coding piqued my interest. Our mentor for the club was this one graduate from the Highschool and I learned a lot from him. He had a lot of passion when teaching us how to code and was really into game dev which sparked my interest with coding as well as wanting to make a game.  He taught us Java and in the beginning it was really difficult to understand what the syntax was as well as what meant anything.  But eventually I got somewhat of the hang of it. My brother also wants to persue a career in computer science or something related to it and without him I wouldn't be where I am today because I wouldn't have had the beginner tips to help me in college as well as the want to persue this as a career.  
Throughout my college experience, I hope to become more confident with my skills and abilities. I want to continue learning and challenging myself so that I can grow both technically and personally. I also hope that in the future, I will be content with the decisions I have made that led up to where I am, knowing that each step—whether a success or a challenge—has contributed to my progress. Ultimately, I want to look back and feel proud of the effort I put in, the knowledge I gained, and the experiences that shaped me along the way. At the very least I want to hopefully still have the want to make a project or two here and there for fun.
