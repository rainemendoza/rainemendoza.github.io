## Coding Standards  
One thing I didn’t really think about before this class was how important coding standards are. These are basically a set of rules or guidelines that help you write code in a consistent and readable way. At first, it felt a little unnecessary, but once we started working on team-based projects, I saw how helpful it was. When everyone follows the same format and naming conventions, it becomes so much easier to read and understand each other’s code. Even outside of web development, this is something I see myself using—whether I’m writing scripts, building tools, or just organizing my own projects, following good coding standards helps keep everything clean and clear. It really helped in my latest project where I worked witha team because when we had specific standards and requirements for our code it made it easier to reference and understand the code and not get too lost with everyone working together.

## Development Environments  
Before this course, I thought development environments just meant opening an editor and writing code. But I’ve learned that a good environment includes the editor, extensions, version control, testing tools, and even how your project is structured. All of that plays a big role in how productive and organized you are. Getting comfortable with GitHub, using tools like ESLint, and managing dependencies really changed how I think about building software. It’s not just about writing code—it’s about creating a full setup that supports your work. I can see how this applies to way more than just web apps, and I plan to keep improving how I set up my environments for future projects. I think that there can be uses for different enviornments depending on the project and language you plan to use.

## User Interface Frameworks  
Working with user interface frameworks was a big shift for me. These frameworks, like React or Bootstrap, give you tools to build front-end layouts more efficiently and make things look professional. At first, it was confusing to understand how components worked and how to structure everything, but after some practice, it started to click. What I really took away is how important user experience is when building software. Even outside of websites, if I ever work on an app or game or anything visual, I’ll be thinking about how people interact with it. UI frameworks helped me understand how to make that experience better and more organized. I really enjoy React and how interactive and easy it is to see and change in comparison to angular and pure html and css. I think that I want to try and create more projects related to react or Node.js in the future due to their interactability and scalability that they come with and maybe it will help me land a job.
