## Smart Questions
Smart questions streamline communication, enabling quicker problem-solving and clearer discussions that benefit everyone involved. They also enhance your online reputation, garnering upvotes, followers, and recognition that can open doors to future collaborations and opportunities. Crafting a smart question often leads to deeper understanding as it prompts thoughtful engagement and detailed responses from knowledgeable peers.

## Example  
One user on Stack Overflow asked:  
**"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?"**  

This question is simple yet insightful, making it likely to receive strong responses. One reply provided a code example:  

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    std::sort(data, data + arraySize); // Sorting improves performance

    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)
    {
        for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
        {
            if (data[c] >= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast<double>(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout << elapsedTime << '\n';
    std::cout << "sum = " << sum << '\n';
}
```

They then explained that the order does not matter if they have the same terms inside of the array because going through it will be the same.  

## Example of a not good question
Question: How do I remove the grey border from a Facebook lightbox popup?

Summary: This question lacks specificityâ€”it doesn't specify the programming context or provide any details about attempts made to solve the problem. Without context, responders are left guessing, which can lead to delays in receiving helpful solutions.

Developing the skill of asking smart questions isn't just about technical proficiency; it's about fostering productive dialogue and building a positive presence within the tech community. By analyzing examples of both smart and not-so-smart questions, we can cultivate clearer, more effective communication practices that benefit everyone involved.
