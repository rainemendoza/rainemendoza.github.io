## Smart Questions
Asking good questions helps you communicate better and solve problems faster. It also boosts your online reputation, getting you more followers and opportunities. Smart questions lead to clearer discussions and deeper insights from experts. You may even make friends or get job offers because of the reputation you put out for yourself. This also helps cognitive skills for asking not only good coding questions, but also good questions in general for daily life.

## Example  
One user on Stack Overflow asked:  
**"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?"**  

This question is simple yet insightful, making it likely to receive strong responses. One reply provided a code example:  

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    std::sort(data, data + arraySize); // Sorting improves performance

    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)
    {
        for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)
        {
            if (data[c] >= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast<double>(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout << elapsedTime << '\n';
    std::cout << "sum = " << sum << '\n';
}
```

They then explained that the order does not matter if they have the same terms inside of the array because going through it will be the same.  

## Example of a not good question
Question: How do I remove the grey border from a Facebook lightbox popup?

Summary: This question isn't very specific. It also leaves a lot of room for discussion, too much room, so that when people try to answer, the user may not get a straightforward one due to the vagueity of it.

Learning to ask good questions isn’t just about knowing a topic—it’s about having better conversations and making a good impression in the tech world. Looking at good and bad examples helps us communicate more clearly and effectively.
