I created a Library like system in Java. For this project I wanted to create something that would help test my fundamentals in Java as well be something fun for me to create. I created an interface you could interact with which is able to store Strings as 'books' and also allows there to be multiple users which can also checkout books. The interface allows you to checkout as many books as you add and other little neat things. This was the first big project I worked on and pretty much finished in my free time and was very proud when creating it.
