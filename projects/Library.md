I created a library-like system in Java to test my fundamentals while also making something fun. This project features an interactive interface that allows users to store books as strings, manage multiple users, and check out books. Users can check out as many books as they add, along with other neat functionalities.

This was the first major project I completed in my free time, and I was very proud of the result.
