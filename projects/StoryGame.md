This text-based story game was one of my first coding projects. Inspired by my mentor, who was passionate about game development, I embarked on this journey to learn programming. Despite its simple format and incomplete content, creating this game marked a significant milestone in my coding journey. It serves as a reminder of my progress and growth since then.
