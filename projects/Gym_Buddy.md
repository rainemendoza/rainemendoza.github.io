## Overview
Many university students find the gym intimidating when they first start out at the Rec Center. They want to be more active but feel unsure about using the machines and worry about making mistakes. To help them overcome these hurdles, we've created a gym-meet app. This app lets students connect with others who have similar workout schedules and experience levels. By creating a profile with their gym times and exercise preferences, students can find gym buddies who match their needs. This not only makes going to the gym less daunting but also builds a stronger campus community by bringing students from different majors together. 

## Contributions and Experience
Some things that I did for this project was helping connectiong the profile and schedule page to the database. I also updated the shedule page to have some functionality like adding buttons to add specific workout excersises to specific days. I also helped add little things here and there for the ui side like when signing in the profile and schedule links in the nav appear but when signed out they dont appear. Same with the signed in icon. I feel like I have learned a lot from doing this project. We had a team of five and it was a lot of fun but still challenging. It was good experience working with a team and working off each other strength's and helping each other along the way. I also think I have learned or started to learn a lot about the postgres and how to implement and how I might want to use it in the future.
